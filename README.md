Included is a zip archive of a cyberpatriots practice image I made.
I wrote a program which emulates malware and added it to the image as an exercise in malicious software removal.
The zip is encrypted to ensure that only people who I trust not to extract the sample malware from the VM and use it for nefarious purposes are capable of opening the image.
Feel free to contact me about obtaining the decryption key.
